# How to Run Workshop CLI

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the API keys and add them to the `Resources` folder from the following [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BnHV73TDjjBz409cYiKzdfZMoD3cgLwp?usp=sharing).
3. Install .NET 8.0 by running `Resources/dotnet-runtime-8.0.4-win-x64.exe`.
4. Run `Install.bat` with administrator permissions in the project folder.

### Troubleshooting

1. If the installation doesnâ€™t work, manually install each installer in the `Resources` folder.
2. To restart the CLI, delete the `session.txt` file from the `Resources` folder, or run the `delete_session.bat` script.
3. If the `Resources` folder is incomplete, check the files on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gVgpg3qHIyZw43Nk-zmTdFIFGjQzUcOD?usp=sharing).

# How to Create Game Builds

2. Run the script `tools/build_game.py` and pass the folder with the games as an argument.
3. The script will create a zip file containing the game code and an `.exe` file inside the specified folder.
